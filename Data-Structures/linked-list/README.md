# Singly Linked List
Code Challenges 05, 06, and 07 for 401 Course

## Challenge
* Challenge 05: Create three prototype functions for single linked list class; insert, include, and toString
* Challenge 06: Create three prototype functions of linked list class; append, insert after, and insert before;
* Challenge 07: Create a prototype function for finding the nth value from the end of a linked list

## Approach & Efficiency
I took the approach of minimizing big O space/time by keeping my functions simplistic and focused on only what was necessary to complete the task.
Big O space is O(1) and time is O(n);

## API
- .insert();
  - Insert a node at the beginning of a linked list
- .include();
  - Search for a value in a linked list and return true or false
- .toString()
  - Output a string of the contents of a linked list
- .append()
  - Add a node to the end of the linked list with a specified value
- .insertBefore()
  - Insert a node with a given value before a specified node
- .insertAfter()
  - Insert a node with a given value after a specified node;
- .kthFromEnd()
  - A function that finds the value kth from the end of the linked list
