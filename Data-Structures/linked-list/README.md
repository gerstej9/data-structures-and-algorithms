# Singly Linked List
Code Challenge 05 for 401 Course

## Challenge
Create three prototype functions for single linked list class:

## Approach & Efficiency
I took the approach of minimizing big O space/time by keeping my functions simplistic and focused on only what was necessary to complete the task.
Big O space is O(1) and time is O(n);

## API
- .insert();
  - Insert a node at the beginning of a linked list
- .include();
  - Search for a value in a linked list and return true or false
- .toString()
  - Output a string of the contents of a linked list
