#### Reverse an Array

#### Challenge
* This challenge involves taking an array and returning an array this is the exact reverse of the original.

#### Approach & Efficiency
I approached this problem using a for loop and pushing the values of the original to a new array starting with the last and working backwards with an i--. This took me approximately five minutes but big 0 space/time could have taken at most 20 minutes.
