# Stacks and Queues
Code Challenge 08 of Code Fellows Class 401

## Challenge
* Create a Stack class that instantiates a class, with a constructor with the value top, prototype functions, push, pop, peek, and isEmpty
* Create a Queue class that instantiates a queue, with a constructor with values front and rear, and prototype functions enqueue, dequeue, peek, and isEmpty

## Approach & Efficiency
* I took the approach of creating functions with O(1) and O(n) Big O space/time.

## Solution
The solution to these problems are relatively straightforward and involve making sure that the nodes in each linked list, whether queue or stack, are properly oriented and this depends on whether they are in a queue, first in first out, or a stack, first in last out.
