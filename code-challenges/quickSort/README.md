# Quick Sort 
Code Challenge 28 of Code Fellows Class 401

## Challenge
Create a function that will sort an array by utilizing a pivot point within an array and halve the array at the point before proceeding to sort each half recursively.

## Approach & Efficiency
The approach I took was working through a whiteboard for this process. I utilized the pseudo code to create a visual walkthrough and then using my understanding of the process afterwords I wrote the code. This approach has a big O space of O(log n) and time of O(nLog(n));
